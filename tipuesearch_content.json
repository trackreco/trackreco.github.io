It consists of two counter-circulating proton beams made to interact in four locations around a 27 kilometer ring straddling the border between Switzerland and France. It is by some measures the largest man-made scientific device on the planet. The goal of the LHC is to probe the basic building blocks of matter and their interactions. In 2012, the Higgs boson was discovered by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. Experimentally, we collide proton beams at the center of our detectors and, by measuring the energy and momentum of the escaping particles, infer the existence of massive particles that were created and decayed in the pp collision and measure those massive particles' properties. In all cases, track reconstruction, i.e., the determination of the trajectories of charged particles (\"tracks\") from a set of positions of energy deposits from the various layers in our detector (\"hits\"), plays a key role in identifying particles and measuring their charge and momentum. Track reconstruction, also known as tracking, as a whole is the most computationally complex and time consuming, most sensitive to increased activity in the detector, and traditionally, least amenable to parallelized processing.","tags":"pages","title":""},{"url":"/pages/team.html.html","text":"Project Team Peter Elmer (PI) - Princeton University, Department of Physics Peter Wittich (PI) - Cornell University, Department of Physics Avi Yagil (PI) - University of California, San Diego, Department of Physics Frank Wuerthwein (PI) - University of California San Diego, Department of Physics Matthieu Lefebvre - Princeton University, Research Computing Dan Riley - Cornell University, Department of Physics Kevin McDermott - Cornell University, Department of Physics Steve Lantz - Cornell University, Center for Advanced Computing Giuseppe Cerati - University of California San Diego, Department of Physics Slava Krutelyov - University of California San Diego, Department of Physics Matevz Tadel - University of California San Diego, Department of Physics Acknowledgement This project is supported by National Science Foundation grants PHY-1520942, PHY-1520969, PHY-1521042 and PHY-1120138.
